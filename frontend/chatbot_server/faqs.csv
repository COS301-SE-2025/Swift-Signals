"What problem does Swift Signals solve?","Swift Signals addresses traffic congestion, which is a major infrastructure challenge in South Africa causing significant annual productivity losses. "
"What is a simulation in Swift Signals?","A simulation models traffic behaviour at an intersection using historical or real-world data to analyse congestion patterns, vehicle throughput, and signal performance. "
"How does the optimization feature work?","The system uses Swarm Optimization Algorithms, like Particle Swarm Optimization, to generate and evaluate multiple traffic light timing configurations to find the most efficient ones based on metrics like wait time and vehicle throughput. "
"What kind of data can I see in the simulation results?","Simulation results provide detailed performance metrics, including trip-level data like vehicle waiting times, intersection-level data like traffic flow and mean speed, and environmental impact data like CO2 and NOx emissions. "
"Can I upload my own traffic data?","Yes, traffic department users can upload real-world traffic data to create simulations based on actual conditions. "
"What technologies does the Swift Signals frontend use?","The frontend is a responsive web portal built with the React framework, TypeScript as the language, and styled with Tailwind CSS. "
"What is the system's architecture?","Swift Signals is built on a microservices architecture, where core functions like the user service, simulation service, and optimization service are separate, independently deployable components that communicate via gRPC. "
"What is SUMO?","SUMO stands for 'Simulation of Urban Mobility.' It is the underlying simulation engine that the Swift Signals Simulation Service uses to model traffic and execute simulations. "
"What roles can users have?","The system is designed for different user roles, such as 'Admin,' 'Engineer,' and 'Viewer,' to allow for collaboration and role-based access. "
"How do I create a new simulation?","You can start a new simulation from the Dashboard via the 'Run Simulation' quick action button, or from the Simulations page via the 'New Simulation' button which opens a modal to configure the simulation. "
"Can I model different types of intersections?","Yes, the system is designed to be extensible and support complex intersection types beyond basic 4-way intersections, such as those with variable lane counts or turn-only lanes. "
"Can the system optimize more than one intersection at a time?","Support for optimizing multiple intersections simultaneously is a key objective for future scalability. "
"What are the performance targets for the system?","Web interface interactions are designed to complete within 2 seconds, and a single intersection optimization should complete within 30 seconds under normal conditions. "
"Who developed Swift Signals?","Swift Signals is a capstone project for the University of Pretoria, developed by Inside Insights in collaboration with Southern Cross Solutions (Pty) Ltd. "
"What is the difference between a simulation and an optimization?","A simulation runs a traffic model with one specific set of signal timings to analyze its performance. An optimization automatically runs many different simulations with various timing plans to discover the most efficient configuration based on your goals, such as minimizing wait time."
"What do the different simulation statuses like 'Complete', 'Running', or 'Failed' mean?","'Complete' indicates the simulation finished successfully and results are available. 'Running' means the simulation is currently in progress. 'Failed' signifies that an error occurred, and you may need to review the simulation's configuration."
"How are the 'Top Intersections' on the dashboard determined?","The 'Top Intersections' list highlights the intersections with the highest vehicle throughput or traffic volume based on the data from recent simulations, helping you quickly identify the busiest areas."
"How do I view the results of a completed simulation?","From the 'Recent Simulations' table on the Dashboard or the main Simulations page, you can click the 'View Details' or 'View Results' button for any 'Complete' simulation to see its full report and metrics."
"What information is needed to add a new intersection?","To add a new intersection, you typically need to provide key details such as a unique name for the intersection, its geographical location or address, and information about its layout, like the number of lanes and their directions."
"What happens to my data if I delete an intersection?","Deleting an intersection removes it from the list for future simulations. However, past simulation results that included that intersection are typically preserved in their respective reports for historical analysis."
"What are the main differences between the 'Admin', 'Engineer', and 'Viewer' roles?","'Admin' users have full system access, including user management. 'Engineers' can create, run, and manage simulations and optimizations. 'Viewers' have read-only access to view dashboards and simulation results but cannot create or change anything."
"Who can add new users to the platform?","Managing users, which includes adding, editing, or deleting accounts, is a permission typically reserved for users with the 'Admin' role."
"Is there a limit to how many intersections I can include in one simulation?","The system is designed to handle complex scenarios with multiple intersections. While there isn't a fixed limit, the time it takes to complete a simulation will increase with the number of intersections and the complexity of the traffic model."
"Is my uploaded traffic data secure?","Yes, data security is a priority. The platform uses role-based access control, meaning users can only access the data and features permitted by their assigned role. All data is handled according to standard security practices."
"How can I get help if I'm stuck?","The application includes a built-in Help Menu which provides access to interactive tutorials and a chat assistant to answer your questions."
Question,Answer
"How up-to-date is the information on the main dashboard?","The dashboard provides a summary based on the most recently completed simulations. Key metrics are updated each time a new simulation or optimization run finishes, giving you the latest insights from your models."
"What are the different ways I can add an intersection to a new simulation?","You can add intersections in three ways: selecting from the 'List' of intersections already saved in the system, using the 'Search' tab to find one by its name or ID, or clicking on the interactive 'Map' tab to choose a geographical location."
"Why does the platform use a microservices architecture?","The microservices architecture makes the system highly scalable and resilient. It allows individual components, like the simulation engine or user service, to be updated and maintained independently without disrupting the entire platform."
"Can I change a simulation's name or description after I've created it?","Once a simulation is created and has run, its name and description are saved as part of its permanent record for historical tracking. To use a different name, you can configure and run a new simulation."
"What timezone is used for timestamps like 'Last Login'?","All timestamps within the platform are displayed in your local timezone. For you, this is South Africa Standard Time (SAST)."
"Can I customize the graphs on my dashboard?","The main dashboard provides a high-level overview. For more detailed analysis, you can navigate to the 'Reports' section or view the results of a specific simulation, which offer more granular data and filtering options."
